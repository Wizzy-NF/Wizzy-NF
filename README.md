## About me 

Hi thereðŸ‘‹! I'm Wisdom, a `passionate programmer` with a love for gamesðŸŽ® and codingðŸ’». My current tech stack includes HTML, CSS, and I'm currently diving into JavaScript and learning version control. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest video games or tinkering with coding projects. I'm excited to continue growing my skills and contributing to the world of programming.
